# Azure AI workshop resources

There are two ways you can run this workshop.

1. As part of an event, Azure AI resources are provided for you. In this case, you'll be given an Azure AI Proxy Endpoint and a time bound API Key to access the Azure AI resources. Follow the instructions in the [Event Access to Azure AI Resources](azure_proxy.md) section.

2. You can provision your own Azure AI resources, this takes longer, but you'll have access to the resources for as long as you need them. Follow the instructions in the [Provision your own Azure AI resources](azure_provision.md) section.
