# Azure AI workshop resources

There are two ways you can run this workshop.

1. As part of an event, you are provided with Azure AI resources for the workshop. Here, you will receive an [Azure AI Proxy](https://aka.ms/ai-proxy-docs) Endpoint and a time-bound API Key to access the Azure AI resources. Follow the instructions in the [Event Access to Azure AI Resources](azure_proxy.md) section.

2. You can provision your own Azure AI resources, this takes longer, but you'll have access to the resources for as long as you need them. Follow the instructions in the [Provision your own Azure AI resources](azure_provision.md) section.
